This is my experimental reStructuredText resume repo, under CC-BY-SA-3.0 license. There's also a style sheet and fun Appendix A with a diagram and everything.

To build resume and graphics from source requires recent versions of the following dependencies:

* media-gfx/graphviz
* dev-python/rst2pdf
* dev-python/docutils
* sys-devel/make
